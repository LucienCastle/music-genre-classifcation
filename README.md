## Features

- Automatic music genre classification based on audio data.
- Pretrained models for easy classification.
- Extensible and customizable for experimentation.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.

## Getting Started

Clone to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Pip (Python package manager)

## Training Data

The project uses the [Music Audio Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODwfK0UYhiD5Yv7lmDUIvuNQu3YIcSkW/view?usp=sharing) dataset for training. The dataset consists of audio features extracted from a collection of Creative Commons-licensed tracks.

## Model Architecture

The music genre classification model is based on a deep learning architecture, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model takes audio features, such as spectrograms, as input and predicts the genre of the music. Other models use numeric features extracted from the audio data to predict the genre of the music.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. These metrics assess the model's ability to correctly classify music into different genres.
